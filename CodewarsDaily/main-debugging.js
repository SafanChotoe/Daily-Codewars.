// I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.

// Can you figure out what's wrong here?
function swapValues(arr) {
    return arr.reverse();
}

// reverse method in js simply reverses the element order in the given Array.apply
//Amazingly simple!
